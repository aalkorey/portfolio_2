                            Also while working for Redcon Properties (Check the decision tree regressor project overview for details on the company if you haven't already), the chairman of the board of directors wanted to understand the causes behind the fluctuation in the price of electricity in Egypt in preperation for the launching of The Golden Gate project and the electricty use associated with that. Historically, electricity in Egypt was subsidized by the government, yet in the past 10 years the government has gradually reduced the amount of subsidization it offers. With each reduction the price of electricity shifts. Yet, the times chosen by the government to reduce their subsidization levels were not evenly spaced out, indicating their decisions were likely reactions to certain events. Thus, to conduct the study, I chose to research news articles published in the 6 month time period before each price change over the last 10 years to look for potential drivers for the governemnt's decisions to reduce subsidies, and as such reduce the price of electricity.

                        <p>
                            In order to study these articles, I chose to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a type of topic modelling where probability distributions are utilized to identify words that frequently co-appear in documents, and then are grouped into one topic. The analysis was conducted used Python, and after running LDA on my entire corpus of news articles, I was left with about 10 topics, which I considered to be candidates for the drivers. After analyzing the words in each topic, I was able to decipher a title for each topic, effectively finding out what the drivers were.

                        The results of the study were presented to the CEO, who was tasked with relaying whatever he saw should be shared with the board of directors.
