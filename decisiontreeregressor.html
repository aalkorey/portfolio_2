                            Redcon Properties is a Cairo-based real estate developer. While working on it's project 'The Golden Gate', a mixed-use project with restaurants, cafes, clothing stores and offices, the project control team wanted to reduce construction costs given their responsibility of optimizing spending. From the already established ways of doing so within the development industry is to directly procure the construction materials instead of having the construction company purchase them then charge a service fee. In order to optimize the use of direct procurement as a means of cost reduction, effort can be expended in to choosing the best time to purchase the needed items, given that prices shift across time. In light of this, items needed in the coming future were assesed for the major raw materials used to produce them, and it was decided that the producer price index of these raw materials, namely copper and aluminum, should be estimated in order to decide on the optimal time to purchase the items.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to do this, I researched to find out which variables effect the price of copper and aluminum. Upon finding this out, I collected historical data pertaining to these metrics, then collected historical data pertaining to the PPI for copper and aluminum from authenticated sources like the US's Federal Reserve website for economic data (FRED). I then organized my training set so that the inputs were associated with one date, then had as one output variable the copper/aluminum PPI for a month ahead, then another output for the PPI 2 months ahead, and so on until reaching 12 months ahead. This way, for a given set of inputs, I had 12 outputs, and this set up enabled me to use the input variables of the current date to estimate the PPI for 12 months ahead, one month at a time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then trained a multi-output decision tree regressor with Python, using exponential smoothing (a type of statistical time-series analysis) as my baseline level performance. I was able to reach under 5% error across all months.

                    <h3>Key Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project control team was pleased with the results, but the model did not end up getting used due to a decision from the company's top management. Nonetheless, I checked on the actual copper and aluminum PPI fluctuations on a monthly basis, and the model did relatively well on estimating the trends, showcasing how it could in fact be a valuable asset for a decision-maker in the project control team.
